# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

This repository contains a Python script that uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict stock prices. The model is trained on historical stock data fetched from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library.

## Features

- Fetches stock data from Yahoo Finance.
- Preprocesses the stock data using MinMax scaling.
- Builds and trains an LSTM model to predict future stock prices.
- Visualizes the actual vs predicted stock prices.
- Displays the actual and predicted prices for each date.

## Requirements

To run the script, you will need the following Python packages:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `yfinance`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow`

You can install the required packages by running:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas yfinance matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
